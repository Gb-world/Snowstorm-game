    "You went for winter fishing at a lake as your relaxation activity. After hours of fishing, you notice an increase in the wind speed. You then checked your weather app and saw a deadly snowstorm approaching. You quickly pack your fishing equipment to where you parked your car so you can leave the environment as soon as possible before the snowstorm begins. After packing your fishing equipment, you tried starting your car, and you noticed your car was faulty. You remember that the area you were in is notorious for very deadly snowstorms, and the storm will damage your car, and you will end up suffering from frostbite, which will lead to death. You have to troubleshoot the car problem to the best of your knowledge, possibly detect the error, seek help from the surroundings, repair the car, and leave the vicinity as soon as possible before the snowstorm then return to your family. \n",
